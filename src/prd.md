## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke trust, professionalism, and technical competence. Visitors should immediately sense this is written by someone who understands software development deeply.

**Design Personality**: Clean, modern, and minimalist with a focus on readability. The aesthetic should feel like a senior developer's personal workspace - organized, purposeful, and free of unnecessary decoration.

**Visual Metaphors**: Code editor aesthetics, clean technical documentation style, subtle references to development tools and environments.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Strongly minimal - the interface should disappear and let the content shine.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with subtle accent colors

**Primary Color**: Deep charcoal/black - conveys professionalism and technical depth
**Secondary Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds and subtle hierarchy
**Accent Color**: Subtle blue - used sparingly for interactive elements and highlights
**Color Psychology**: The palette should feel serious and professional, like a technical specification or high-quality documentation

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Light theme: Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) on light backgrounds (oklch(0.98 0 0))
- Dark theme: Light text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) on dark backgrounds (oklch(0.08 0 0))
- All pairings exceed WCAG AA contrast ratios

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single high-quality sans-serif for all content with monospace for code

**Selected Fonts**: 
- **Primary**: Inter - excellent legibility and professional appearance
- **Code**: JetBrains Mono - designed specifically for developers

**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body text, and code snippets
**Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing, optimal line length, comfortable reading sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Content-first design where the interface guides readers naturally through posts
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates calm, focused reading environment
**Grid System**: Simple, consistent layout that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes
**Content Density**: Balanced - enough information without overwhelming the reader

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for post previews and content sections
- Buttons for primary actions (read, edit, create)
- Badges for tags and metadata
- Modal dialogs for post creation/editing

**Component States**: Subtle hover effects, clear focus states for accessibility
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for their clean, technical aesthetic
